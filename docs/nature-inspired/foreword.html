<p>
I am delighted to write this foreword. This book, a reference where one can look up the details of most any algorithm to find a clear unambiguous description, has long been needed and here it finally is.  A concise reference that has taken many hours to write but which has the capacity to save vast amounts of time previously spent digging out original papers.
</p>
<p>
I have known the author for several years and have had experience of his amazing capacity for work and the sheer quality of his output, so this book comes as no surprise to me.  But I hope it will be a surprise and delight to you, the reader for whom it has been written.
</p>
<p>
But useful as this book is, it is only a beginning. There are so many algorithms that no one author could hope to cover them all. So if you know of an algorithm that is not yet here, how about contributing it using the same clear and lucid style?
